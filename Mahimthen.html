    <h2>Mahim - Then </h2>
    <p>
     
      >> The name Mahim is derived from the ancient Mahikavati meaning "miraculous" in Sanskrit. <br>
      >> Other historical names for the area include Mahimawati, Maijim, and Mejambu. <br>
      >> Mahim was one of the seven islands that originally made up Mumbai.  <br>
     >> Mahim, or Mahikavati as it was known, was the capital of Raja Bhimdev, who reigned over the region in the 13th century. <br>
     >> He built a palace and a court of justice in Prabhadevi, as well as the first Babulnath temple. br
     >> In 1343, this island was possessed by the Delhi Sultanate. It was in their reign that the old Mahim mosque was built. <br>
     >> A dargah of Makhdoom Ali Mahimi was built here in 1431.In 1543, the Portuguese captured the islands of Mumbai. <br>
     >> In 1662, these islands were given to the English King, King Charles II, as a part of the wedding dowry for the Portuguese princess, Catherine of Braganza. <br>
     >> After the British acquired Mumbai, they built the Mahim Fort here to protect themselves from the Marathas. <br>
     >> The causeway connecting Mahim and Bandra (corrupted from "Bunder" meaning port in Persian) was completed in 1845 at a cost of Rs. 1,57,000 donated entirely by Lady Avabai Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy, wife of the first baronet Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy with a stipulation that no toll would be charged to citizens for its use by the government.
