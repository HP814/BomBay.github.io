    <h2>Mahim - Now </h2>
    <p>
     
      >> Mahim Bay is a large bay, part of the Arabian Sea in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. <br>
     >> The southern end is Worli, the northern end is Bandra Reclamation and Mahim is in the centre. <br>
     >> Mahim Creek is a 15 feet (4.6 m) deep creek. The Mithi River drains into the creek which drains into the Mahim Bay. <br>
     >> It forms the boundary between the city (Churchgate to Mahim)and suburbs (Bandra to Dahisar) of Mumbai. <br>
     >> The creek is swamped by mangroves and has a mini-ecosystem. <br>
     >> It now has the Bandra-Kurla complex with corporate offices on both its sides. <br>
     >> The waters of the creek are foul smelling due to the dumping of untreated industrial effluents upstream. <br> In recent years, the mushrooming of slums around the waters has caused concern for the mangrove ecosystem, vital to the ecosystem of Mumbai. <br>
     >> The Mahim Causeway is a vital link road connecting the neighbourhoods of Mahim in Mumbai City district to Bandra in Mumbai Suburban district.
