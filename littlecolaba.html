    <h2> Little Colaba  </h2>
    <p>
     
    >> Located on the southern side of the city of Mumbai, the Colaba and Old Womanâ€™s Island is considered to be the most beautiful among the seven islands of Mumbai. <br> 
    >> Like the Mazagaon islet, this one, too, was the home of fishermen in the 16th century. <br> 
    >> During that time, the isle was known as the island of Kolis. <br> 
    >> However, after the Portuguese people took over this islet, they changed its name to Candil Island. <br>
    >> This part of Mumbai is mainly known for housing some of the best and most famous hotels in India. <br> 
    >> Among them, the Taj Mahal Hotel Palace is one of the most notable names. <br> 
    >> Apart from these, you can also spend your time here by roaming around some of the other attractions of this section. <br> 
    >> However, if you really want to enjoy your time around here, then make sure to check out the night bars of this place.
